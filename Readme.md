# Transloadit jQuery SDK

The official docs for our jQuery plugin / SDK are on the
[transloadit website](http://transloadit.com/docs/jquery-plugin).

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this project. We will happily merge bug fixes or other small
improvements. For bigger changes you should probably get in touch with us
before you start to avoid not seeing them merged.

## Building

Building your own compressed version requires a *nix operation system and curl.
We are using the [Google Closure REST API](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_api.html)
for minification.

    make

The minified output file can be found in: `build/jquery.transloadit2.js`.
